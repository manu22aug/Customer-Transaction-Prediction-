The dataset is anonymized so we cannot know which feature is what. There are a total of 200 features in this data set along with ID_code and target columns. The target columns contain 0 and 1 value where 0 means the customer will not do a transaction and 1 means the customer will do a transaction.
we have predictive model which will help the bank to identify which customer will make transactions in future.
